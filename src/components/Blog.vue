        <h1>Lunar Phases: Let's Draw the Moon</h1>
        <h2>July 26, 2024</h2>

        <div id="moon-blog" class="flex flex-col space-y-8 mb-8">
          <p>
            I found a hoodie recently with the phases of the moon depicted on
            the front. I love it. I wanted to recreate the design myself.
          </p>

          <img src="../assets/blog/moon/1.jpg" />

          <p>
            I know that in real life, this effect is caused by differences in
            the moon's position in relation to the sun and the earth resulting
            from its orbit. So we could solve the problem in 3d and project the
            solution into 2d.
          </p>

          <p>
            But, looking at this problem, it seems like we can pretend that
            everything is just happening on a plane. The moon is just a circle.
            And the shadow cut occurs along some other circle that intersects
            with the moon at its exact top and bottom.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can imagine the entire family of these circles, all of their
            centers lying along some line through the center of the "moon".
          </p>

          <img src="../assets/blog/moon/5.jpeg" />

          <p>
            (In the extreme case, we can imagine the center of the second circle
            wandering off further and further to the left, all the way to
            infinity, at which point we get a perfect diameter cutting the
            moon.)
          </p>

          <p>
            Our strategy will be to (a) find some way to parameterize the
            progression of the shadow. (Imagine the second circle moving toward
            or away from the "moon".) It doesn't really matter if we think of
            this parameter as time, or whatever. It's just the variable whose
            value we are going to "snapshot" at 28 (or however many) different
            points, to generate our final output.
          </p>

          <p>
            And once we know how far away to draw the circle, we want to (b)
            know how large to draw second circle, given its distance away from
            the moon. Let's start with (b). Call the radius of moon R<sub
              >2</sub
            >
            and the radius that we are seeking R<sub>1</sub>. Call the distance
            between the circle's centers D.
          </p>

          <img src="../assets/blog/moon/6.jpeg" />

          <p>
            A little trigonometry reveals the crucial relationship between the
            second circle's radius (R<sub>1</sub>) and its distance from the
            "moon" (D). We have a right triangle with hypotenuse R<sub>1</sub>
            and legs D and R<sub>2</sub> (the moon's radius). (We know the
            triangle is right because we chose the intersection point of R<sub
              >1</sub
            >
            and R<sub>2</sub> to be the top/bottom of the moon.)
          </p>

          <p>
            So we have
            <code
              >R<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> = R<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + D<sup
                >2</sup
              ></code
            >. We can take the square root of the right-hand side, that that
            will be an expression for R<sub>1</sub> in terms of D. (The moon's
            radius, R<sub>2</sub>, is just a constant whose value we can
            control.) Part (b) solved!
          </p>

          <p>
            If we knew how to drive the changing distance D, we could move on to
            rendering. So let's resolve that: that's part (a).
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (a) is a bit more hand-wavey. We can imagine that at the start
            of the cycle, the two circles are perfectly aligned. What happens as
            we nudge our circle out in one direction, say the left?
          </p>
          <p>
            As time (our parameter) goes on, the second circle moves away from
            the moon. Eventually, it goes all the way out to infinity,
            <i>wraps around to the other side</i>, and comes back from the other
            direction, to ultimately align with the moon again.
          </p>

          <p>
            Is there a function that behaves that way in the ambit of
            trigonometry? That follows such a wild path, shooting out to
            infinity and then, as if by magic, blasting back from the other
            side?
          </p>
          <p>Fortunately there is! It is the tangent function!</p>

          <img
            src="https://mathbooks.unl.edu/PreCalculus/images/imagesChap13/tangentgraph.png"
          />

          <p>
            So I took a guess that we want to let D vary with the tangent of the
            parameterized variable. That's our tentative solution to part (a).
            Let's see how it looks.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
          Since trigonometric functions tend to complete a full cycle between 0
          and 2Ï€, this is the range we vary through.
        </p> -->

          <p>
            The final part of the problem, call it (c) for good measure, is to
            handle SVG masking to let us render the circles with the "shadow"
            regions cut out. (I suppose WebGL would have worked well for this
            purpose too.)
          </p>
          <p>
            In my approach, we start with either a black or white circle (more
            on that in a second). Then we draw a second circle over the top of
            it, fill it with the opposite color, and offset and scale it by a
            certain amount (which we found in (a) and (b)). But this second
            circle must be "masked" so that we only render the part of it that
            overlaps with the original circle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final wrinkle was that we need to swap between using a black or
            white circle as the "base" circle, halfway through the cycle. (We
            swap at the first and last quarters of the moon.)
          </p>

          <p>
            (One other wrinkle involved allowing the circle's distance and
            radius to grow toward infinity. Computers don't love infinite
            values. So I just capped them at some large number.)
          </p>

          <p>
            So in code, we have a dynamically generated SVG (created with a
            nested loop, running through the rows and columns of our grid), each
            "cell" of which contains three elements:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>a circle to represent the moon</li>
            <li>
              a mask element (containing a circle coinciding with the original
              circle)
            </li>
            <li>
              and a circle (offset and scaled) to represent the shadow (or lit
              part), who uses the masking element as a mask
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            (We couldn't just re-use the moon circle as the mask, because of the
            fill-related wrinkle mentioned above. SVG masks are a bit finicky,
            requiring a specific "fill" of black or white to determine how the
            masking is applied.)
          </p>

          <p>
            To pull it all together, this is basically how it looks in code:
          </p>

          <code>
            const dayPercent = dayCounter / 28; <br /><br />// Part (a),
            paramaterize the motion of the shadow: <br />const xOffsetScale =
            Math.tan(dayPercent * 2 * Math.PI); <br />// Offset the mask
            according to the paramaterized variable: <br />const xOffset =
            MOON_RADIUS * xOffsetScale; <br /><br />
            // Part (b), determine the size of the shadow: <br />let
            moonShadowRadius = Math.sqrt(xOffset * xOffset + MOON_RADIUS *
            MOON_RADIUS); <br />// Cap the size of the shadow to avoid antics
            with infinity: <br />moonShadowRadius = Math.min(moonShadowRadius,
            99_999); <br /><br />// Part (c), handle rendering: <br />const
            moonShadow = document.createElement("circle");
            <br />moonShadow.setAttribute("cx", MOON_RADIUS + i * MOON_RADIUS *
            2 + xOffset);<br />
            moonShadow.setAttribute("cy", MOON_RADIUS + j * MOON_RADIUS * 2);<br />
            moonShadow.setAttribute("r", moonShadowRadius);<br />
            moonShadow.setAttribute("fill", invert ? "black" : "white");<br />
            moonShadow.setAttribute("mask", `url(#moon-mask-${i}-${j})`);<br />
            svg.appendChild(moonShadow);<br />
          </code>

          <p>
            The final result is a grid of circles, each of which represents a
            different phase of the moon. The shadow moves across the moon in a
            way that is consistent with the real-life phenomenon -- or at least,
            close enough for me, for now.
