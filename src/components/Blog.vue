        <div id="moon-blog" class="flex flex-col space-y-8 mb-8">
          <p>
            I found a hoodie recently with the phases of the moon depicted on
            the front. I love it. I wanted to recreate the design myself.
          </p>

          <img src="../assets/blog/moon/1.jpg" />

          <p>
            I know that in real life, this effect is caused by differences in
            the moon's position in relation to the sun and the earth resulting
            from its orbit. So we could solve the problem in 3d and project the
            solution into 2d.
          </p>

          <p>
            But, looking at this problem, it seems like we can pretend that
            everything is just happening on a plane. The moon is just a circle.
            And the shadow cut occurs along some other circle that intersects
            with the moon at its exact top and bottom.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can imagine the entire family of these circles, all of their
            centers lying along some line through the center of the "moon".
          </p>

          <img src="../assets/blog/moon/5.jpeg" />

          <p>
            (In the extreme case, we can imagine the center of the second circle
            wandering off further and further to the left, all the way to
            infinity, at which point we get a perfect diameter cutting the
            moon.)
          </p>

          <p>
            Our strategy will be to (a) find some way to parameterize the
            progression of the shadow. (Imagine the second circle moving toward
            or away from the "moon".) It doesn't really matter if we think of
            this parameter as time, or whatever. It's just the variable whose
            value we are going to "snapshot" at 28 (or however many) different
            points, to generate our final output.
          </p>

          <p>
            And once we know how far away to draw the circle, we want to (b)
            know how large to draw second circle, given its distance away from
            the moon. Let's start with (b). Call the radius of moon R<sub
              >2</sub
            >
            and the radius that we are seeking R<sub>1</sub>. Call the distance
            between the circle's centers D.
          </p>

          <img src="../assets/blog/moon/6.jpeg" />

          <p>
            A little trigonometry reveals the crucial relationship between the
            second circle's radius (R<sub>1</sub>) and its distance from the
            "moon" (D). We have a right triangle with hypotenuse R<sub>1</sub>
            and legs D and R<sub>2</sub> (the moon's radius). (We know the
            triangle is right because we chose the intersection point of R<sub
              >1</sub
            >
            and R<sub>2</sub> to be the top/bottom of the moon.)
          </p>

          <p>
            So we have
            <code
              >R<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> = R<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + D<sup
                >2</sup
              ></code
            >. We can take the square root of the right-hand side, that that
            will be an expression for R<sub>1</sub> in terms of D. Part (b)
            solved!
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (a) is a bit more hand-wavey. We can imagine that at the start
            of the cycle, the two circles are perfectly aligned. As time (our
            parameter) goes on, the second circle moves away from the moon.
            Eventually, it goes all the way out to infinity, wraps around to the
            other side, and comes back from the other direction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Is there a function that behaves that way in the ambit of
            trigonometry? That follows such a wild path, shooting out to
            infinity and then, as if by magic, blasting back from the other
            side? Fortunately there is! It is the tangent function!
          </p>

          <img
            src="https://mathbooks.unl.edu/PreCalculus/images/imagesChap13/tangentgraph.png"
          />

          <p>
            So I took a guess that we want to let D vary with the tangent of the
            parameterized variable. That's our tentative solution to part (a).
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
          Since trigonometric functions tend to complete a full cycle between 0
          and 2Ï€, this is the range we vary through.
        </p> -->

          <p>
            The final part of the problem is to handle SVG masking to let us
            render the circles with the "shadow" regions cut out. (I suppose
            WebGL would have worked well for this purpose too.)
          </p>
          <p>
            In my approach, we start with either a black or white circle (more
            on that in a second). Then we draw a second circle over the top of
            it, fill it with the opposite color, and offset and scale it by a
            certain amount (which we found in (a) and (b)). But this second
            circle must be "masked" so that we only show the part of it that
            overlaps with the original circle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final wrinkle was that we need to swap between using a black or
            white circle as the "base" circle, halfway through the cycle. (We
            swap at the first and last quarters of the moon.)
          </p>

          <p>
            So in code, we had a dynamically generated SVG (created with a
            nested loop), each "cell" of which contained three elements: a
            circle to represent the moon, a mask element (containin a circle
            coinciding with the one), and a circle (offset and scaled) to
            represent the shadow (or lit part), who used the masking element as
            a mask. (We couldn't just re-use the moon circle as the mask,
            because of the fill-related wrinkle mentioned above.)
          </p>

          <p>
            Anyway, this is the result we ended up with. Not perfect, but close
            enough for now. The full code (messy as it is..) can be found
