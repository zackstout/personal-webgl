          <p>The night sky inspires wonder. It leads to mystery and myth.</p>

          <p>
            The first time I wrote the code to make a circle move in a perfect

          I love to learn, and learning to code (at boot camp, on my own, and

        <p>
          Software development is kind of like what I imagine managing a forest
          to be like. You encourage growth here, burn dead areas away there,
          discourage littering.

        <!-- <p>
          Working in software has been a dream come true. We are rooted in
